        <h1>Day 4: Test and refine</h1>

        <span class="t-summary">On day 4, test prototypes based on the screens you’ve designed, and resolve some of the issues found in user testing.</span>

        <section class="section">
          <h3>Test</h3>
          <p>Before you test, make a plan. How should you present the situation to the user? What exact steps or prompts for action do you share with them? What follow-up questions can you ask if users behave in unexpected ways?</p>

          <dl class="example">
            <dt>Example</dt>
            <dd>When testing a farm share delivery communication app, the scenario might be something like:</dd>
            <dd class="example__quote">“Your delivery is coming - use the app to check on its schedule!”</dd>
            <dd>It’s important to get the users comfortable by giving them a bit of background on why you’re asking them questions, and what you might do with the information. A quick intro will do the job. Here’s a typical introduction:</dd>
            <dd class="example__quote">“We are here with [person they know] to test [explain the product as it relates to user]. What we’re trying to do is make the experience smoother when [action].”</dd>
            <dd>And here’s how you might explain the goal of the test:</dd>
            <dd class="example__quote">“This is not a test of your skills or knowledge. We appreciate the opportunity to show this to you because you already know anything you would need to know for this system, and we are trying to see if the prototype we made is working and find any areas we can improve.”</dd>
          </dl>

          <h3>Testing quickly</h3>
          <p>Design sprints are fast and focused, and user testing should be, too. Limit the scope of tests to one, maximum two simple action paths, and reduce the amount of background information you collect about users compared to a more thorough <a class="t-link" href="https://dockyard.com/blog/2015/02/11/managing-the-conversation" target="_blank">testing process</a> that is more appropriate in a longer Design Discovery. Because of this, it’s important to pay attention to the key UX sticking points like general ease of use, clear language, directed flow, etc.</p>

          <h3>Refine</h3>
          <p>Once test results are ready, go through all the notes to collect what you learned into a single list. Then, decide which ones are actionable. In documenting findings, make sure to separate the test results (e.g. “user did not see the Submit button”) from the proposed action to address them (e. g. “make button bigger,” “add contrast”)</p>
          <p>Next, prioritize the actions, addressing things that are both easy to fix and make a big impact. Move the changes that might take a lot of effort for a lesser payoff to the end of the list. Proceed to refine and adjust the designs if time remains, and document the recommendations for future implementation.</p>

          <dl class="outcome">
            <dt>Document</dt>
            <dd>Since this is the end of the sprint, make sure all the assets and documentation are in top shape to hand over to your client or to share internally with your team. Basecamp is a good tool for a primary long-form communication, but in addition to that, some combination of the below may be needed:</dd>
            <ul>
              <li>Archive and clearly mark older versions of anything</li>
              <li>Export JPEGs and PNGs for any work done in Photoshop or Sketch.</li>
              <li>Export PDFs or PNGs for any work done in OmniGraffle</li>
              <li>Download the offline version of online prototypes</li>
              <li>Export a PDF of documents collaborated on in Google Docs</li>
              <li>Double-check that files and folders are named intuitively</li>
              <li>Collect and zip up all the assets</li>
            </ul>
            <dd>Suggested Assets and Documentation:</dd>
            <ul>
              <li>Original source design files</li>
              <li>Rendered JPGs, PNGs, and PDFs</li>
              <li>Photographs of research: sketches, post it notes, and white board user flows</li>
              <li>Annotated wireframes, user flows, and journey maps</li>
              <li>Online prototypes</li>
            </ul>
            <dd>Make sure to organize all this information in a way that is intuitive even for someone who has not worked on the project.</dd>
