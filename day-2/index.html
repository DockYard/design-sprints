        <h1>Day 2: Sketch and define</h1>

        <span class="t-summary">Now that you have an understanding of the user flow and core interactions, spend today sketching and iterating through ideas. These sketched wireframes will generate conversation around interaction solutions.</span>

        <section class="section">
          <dl class="method">
            <svg><use xlink:href="images/defs.svg#method"></use></svg>
            <dt>Start rough and quick</dt>
            <dd>With the user flows that were developed from Day 1, you should be able to identify and prioritize specific screens to begin sketching. Select the screens that contain the major actions within the user flow, and explore how those interactions might appear in the interface.</dd>
            <dd>Start with quick, rough, individual sketching. Google Ventures describes the Crazy Eights method (eight 30-second sketches on a piece of paper folded into eighths).</dd>
            <dd>Start very quickly: four minutes of sketching with 30 seconds per drawing. Mistakes and messy drawings don’t matter - just keep going! Consider doing this quick round of sketching for every feature or interaction you’re considering.</dd>
            <dd>Then, if some of the ideas are more complex, and call for a more exploration, take a couple of minutes to draw each of them on a separate sheet. Gradually adding detail to this sketch will raise questions about the feature that the group will be able to work on. If all pieces seem simple enough in the 30-second sketch, this step can be skipped to save time.</dd>
          </dl>

          <h3>Share results as a team</h3>
          <p>Once you’ve accumulated crazy and rough ideas in the beginning of Day 2, start sharing them as a group. It is your responsibility as the designer running a sprint to facilitate a neutral, non-judgmental discussion around the ideas. This is where neutral voting systems with dot stickers can come into play. In the beginning, all ideas are good ideas, and often times you start to see patterns in solutions being proposed.</p>
          <p>The subject matter expert at this point has the best context to narrow down the ideas (e.g. “an interface like this is not possible with the limitations of our current system”). While it is critical to get their feedback, it’s also important to properly understand information being shared. What might be causing the limitations they describe? Are there assumptions and common practices the product could challenge?</p>
          <p>As you progress through the day, narrow down the sketching to just a few of the best ideas and draw them out with more detail, even real content. Complex features call for more exploration than simpler or standard UI elements.</p>

          <h3>Team up</h3>
          <p>In the next, detailed, sketching sessions, it’s good to make several teams of one domain expert and one designer. Each team is sketching out a separate set of features. With the crazy ideas and wide exploration out of the way, everyone has had an opportunity to share ideas. So, a collaborative approach is enabling, rather than limiting. It allows for the combination of a designer’s wide toolkit of UI best practices with the domain expert’s deep knowledge.</p>

          <dl class="outcome">
            <dt>The outcome of Day 2</dt>
            <dd>The outcome of the second day is a set of wireframe sketches that accommodate the workflow defined in Day 1. Some of the wireframes have gone through several rounds of sketching and exploration. In addition, there is a pile of “crazy idea” sketches that give context to the direction that was selected to move forward.</dd>
