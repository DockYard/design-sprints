        <h1>Day 1: Analyze context and diverge</h1>

        <span class="t-summary">On the first day, do the most you can to understand your users and their goals. The process may involve journey mapping, user interviews, and in-depth conversations with stakeholders.</span>

        <section class="section">
          <h3>Who are the users? What are their needs?</h3>
          <p>Kick off the sprint by analyzing the situation around the product or feature you’re helping build. Who are the users? What problems do they encounter, and which ones can the product you’re building help them solve?</p>

          <dl class="method">
            <svg><use xlink:href="images/defs.svg#method"></use></svg>
            <dt>Select one or two personas</dt>
            <dd>If there are several types of users, select one or two to focus on, often times the most common use cases. Use these personas to create “user flows” - often times a “happy path” and a more complex one. This allows you to fold in a spectrum of actions and motivations into two primary directed user flows. Even if the finished product addresses many users’ needs, by focusing on one or two primary users, you can move faster and with better focus. After this, you can move forward in a direction you’ve already validated, and address a wider range of personas and use cases in the future.</dd>
          </dl>

          <h3>Consider interviewing real people at the start </h3>
          <p>UX Designers rely a lot on the industry expertise and the experience our teams bring. But when possible, also interview one or two real users in the beginning of a sprint. This brings extra clarity and helps discover unmet needs and opportunities early on.</p>

          <dl class="method">
            <svg><use xlink:href="images/defs.svg#method"></use></svg>
            <dt>Journey map / experience map</dt>
            <dd>It can be useful to make a journey map based on the interviews. The journey map is a high-level way to narrate and diagram the key interactions of the experience. How might the user arrive to the product? How might they use it? How might they engage with the product after use?</dd>
            <dd>The map allows us to identify potential product features in context. Then, it’s much easier to decide which features need to be in or out of scope. This larger view helps to see what you’re considering to build out and how it relates to remaining and unexplored areas.</dd>
          </dl>

          <h3>Start to define actions for the product to accomplish</h3>
          <p>When the product is new, you should start by defining the key interactions. These key interactions can be determined by the user flows, and also from doing research on other products that mirror certain interactions.</p>
          <p>For an existing product, select the interactions you want to help improve, or which ones might be missing and should be explored.</p>

          <dl class="outcome">
            <dt>The outcome of Day 1</dt>
            <dd>The outcome of the first day is an agreed-upon user flow for one or two specific use cases. Another important outcome is a shared understanding of priorities. Make sure to record potential directions that may be out of scope, but possibly be valuable to explore.</dd>
