        <h1>Get started</h1>

        <span class="t-summary">You’ll need some basic supplies to run a sprint. Most of them are likely available around the office, but if you’re not using some of what we’re suggesting - it’s a great opportunity to test out a few new things.</span>

        <div class="section__anchor" id="supplies"></div>
        <section class="section">
          <h2>Supplies</h2>

          <dl class="section__overview">
            <dt>Colorful sticky notes</dt>
            <dd>Colors can help visually separate user personas, goals, and features. You could come up with a different rule for what each sticky color stands for each time - just make sure it’s clear to everyone in the room.</dd>

            <dt>Sharpies</dt>
            <dd>Sharpies are great for making what you wrote on the sticky notes visible across the room. Sharpies also force the writing to be more brief and clear.</dd>

            <dt>Large whiteboard and dry erase markers</dt>
            <dd>Fresh markers are a good idea any day, but especially in a sprint where we’re likely to rely on them so much. Keep the sharpies and the whiteboard markers separated to prevent imminent disaster.</dd>
            <dd>Pro tip: If disaster occurs, draw over the misplaced sharpie marks with whiteboard marker and let it sit for a moment. It can take two or three attempts to get all of the sharpie off.</dd>

            <dt>Dots</dt>
            <dd>You could tear colorful sticky notes into small chunks to indicate votes or to-dos, or use dot stickers! They can save time, are less likely to fall off, and help differentiate what you’ve marked with a distinct shape.</dd>

            <dt>Large sticky pad</dt>
            <dd>Post-it notes are often collected in groups for card sorting or to make a sequence. It’s good to be able to move them around without losing the context. To make that easier, use a large Post-it “wall pad”. These pads are also great for sketching wireframes.</dd>

            <dt>Copy paper</dt>
            <dd>It’s good practice to sketch ideas on loose sheets of paper first. This way, ideas can be reshuffled to change the order, and individual drawings can be discarded and re-drawn as needed. Early, rough sketches work best on materials that feel more disposable than the dot-graph or large post-it paper.</dd>

            <dt>Dot-graph paper, pencils and erasers</dt>
            <dd>For the more detailed wireframe sketches, use graph or dot-graph paper. For best results, use paper large enough to draw out a wireframe or two, and annotate any details and connections. Draw with graphite or blue pencils (they both erase well for quick adjustments). Consider using a color marker to highlight a point of interest: for example, interactive features, or any custom user-submitted content on a page.</dd>
            <dd>It’s best to prepare several mechanical or sharpened No.2 pencils, a couple of rulers, and more erasers than you think you’ll need. Scrambling for supplies in the middle of a sprint can break the momentum and cost valuable time.</dd>

            <dt>Clock</dt>
            <dd>Yes, the timer app on your phone is the easiest and most available choice. But consider using an analog clock. This helps keep focus firmly on the sprint, rather than any notifications that might pop up.</dd>

        <div class="section__anchor" id="set-aside-the-time"></div>
        <section class="section">
          <h2>Set aside the time</h2>
          <p>It is best to plan the sprint on a week when all participants are able to commit. However, it can happen that the key stakeholders representing the product cannot be fully available on all four days. It is sometimes possible to offer flexibility. Their participation is most important during the the first two days of the sprint. High-fidelity sketching, any visual design, and user testing falls later in the week and can be done even if they are not present.</p>

          <h3>Book a dedicated space for the sprint</h3>
          <p>A space where nothing else is happening helps with the team’s focus. It also saves time: sprints use many physical tools, and moving sets of sticky notes or piles of sketches can be a pain.</p>
          <p>When planning out the time - leave some for breaks. Purposefully incorporating breaks and sticking closely to the schedule can help sustain the always-on energy required to run a sprint and prevent burnout.</p>
        </section>

        <div class="section__anchor" id="communicate"></div>
        <section class="section">
          <h2>Communicate expectations</h2>
          <p>As mentioned before, sprints are good at specific things, under specific conditions. Setting expectations correctly is a major component of success.</p>
          <p>Right now - before a sprint has begun - is the perfect time to communicate again what the team can expect out of a sprint, and to ensure they are on board with all the expectations and requirements. Everyone involved deserves the comfort of knowing exactly what is coming and when. It’s our responsibility as professionals to provide that, especially if the sprint format is new.</p>
        </section>

        <div class="section__anchor" id="roles"></div>
        <section class="section">
          <h2>Roles</h2>
          <p>To run a successful sprint, the roles of the participants need to be clear. You should designate one person from the design team as the team leader. This person will be the one responsible for the schedule and process, delegating tasks, and should call out deviations or distractions early rather than allow them to slow down the sprint.</p>
          <p>The team leader should also remind everyone of the task at hand and what deliverables are expected at each point. This makes the process efficient and minimizes confusion.</p>
          <p>The remaining team members are all active participants: there are no passive observers in a sprint. Everyone contributes to ideation, sketching, asking questions, sharing ideas, and validating potential directions.</p>
        </section>

        <div class="section__anchor" id="ensure-success"></div>
        <section class="section">
          <h2>How to ensure success</h2>

          <h3>Gaps</h3>
          <p>The one thing about sprints that’s most often left to assumption is the depth to which you’ll need to explore. Work hard before, during, and after a sprint to communicate what exactly has not been addressed given the scope of work.</p>
          <p>For example, if you focus on two user flows, there might be gaps or missing connections between them. There might be a third, related, user flow, which you won’t address in order to save time.</p>
          <p>Sometimes it’s even prudent to leave out “obvious” things like the login or password reset screens, especially when they can be solved by relying on industry standards. Putting time into making them won’t add as much value to the final product as the effort on the more unique, product-defining interactions.</p>
          <p>This should be cleared up ahead of time. Creating a master user flow that includes visual design screens as well as all wireframes in context can help visualize the gaps between the assets that were created.</p>

          <h3>Assets and target outcome</h3>
          <p>Work should not start until you’ve discussed the desired outcome, assets, and documentation.</p>
          <p>How much documentation is desired? Should you be exploring the space more broadly, or use extra time on visual design instead? Is there need for a clickable prototype? If so, how “real” should the prototype interface look?</p>
          <p>Sprint deliverables can include user flows, hand sketches, wireframes, information architecture diagrams, and high-fidelity clickable prototypes depending on needs. You should not leave any room for unmet expectations around deliverables at the end of a project.</p>
          <p>If the sprint goes very smoothly and faster than expected - figure out how to best spend the remaining time. It might make sense to go wider to explore additional possibilities, or go deeper with more detailed wireframes or visual design of specific interactions. In this case, original expectations have already been met, and you can prioritize tasks for the remaining time.</p>

          <h3>Run a tight schedule</h3>
          <p>It is possible to accomplish a lot in a short 4-day effort. Each day has a target deliverable. The focus is narrowed down, and it’s important to keep moving.</p>
          <p>If a large question comes up and has potential to derail the schedule, highlight it as unresolved, and leave with a suggestion for further exploration. This approach works well for lower-priority or peripheral questions. When the unresolved question is high priority and imperative to the progress of the sprint, you may need to make an informed assumption to proceed, and potentially propose another design sprint.</p>
          <p>Though challenging, it can be good to flag these problems early, and it is up to the team to determine the value for the sprint moving forward. In both cases, make sure the team understands all assumptions and the potential use cases they leave out.</p>
